Hello, world!

This is where I will post all the stuff that I tinker with on a daily basis, to at least preserve some of it (mostly for myself so that I can remember this shit in 10 years, but also for others who might want to try similar things)

I will leave some of the Jekyll default stuff here for now that I might need to lookup later, like how to do Syntax Highlighting with jekyll:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Also a small reminder on how to do references in Jekyll:

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
